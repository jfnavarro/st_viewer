STViewer is an open source application that
uses the open source version of Qt. To comply
the LGPL v3 requirements, instructions on how
to replace the Qt libraries for the end-user must
be given in case you decide to distribute the binaries.

For OSX:

Check what Qt frameworks and plugins are in use :
- otool -L /Applications/STViewer.app/Contents/MacOs/STViewer

Copy the framewors and plugins from your local Qt installation :
- cp -R /path/to/Qt/lib/QtCore.framework STViewer.app/Contents/Frameworks
...
- cp -R /path/to/Qt/plugin/imageformats/libqjpeg.dylib STViewer.app/Contents/PlugIns
...

Set the identification names for the frameworks :
- install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5.0/QtCore
STViewer.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5.0/QtCore
...

Ensure STViewer knows where the frameworks are
- install_name_tool -change path/to/Qt/lib/QtCore.framework/Versions/5.0/QtCore
@executable_path/../Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5.0/QtCore
STViewer.app/Contents/MacOs/plugandpaint
...

For Linux:

The same approach as in OSX (shared libraries are in the folder
lib in the application rool folder and plugins are in the folder
plugins in the application root folder).

For Windows:

The QT DDLs present in the ST Viewer installation folder must
be replaced for the DDLs present in the QT installation folder. 
Libraries are in the folder lib and plugins are in the folder plugins
inside the application folder.
